Lesson

Generating Patterns

What’s In
When you were in grade 8, you learned about concepts related to generating patterns
like Inductive Reasoning. The knowledge and skills you acquired are very important
for you to understand how to generate patterns and sequences. Hence, let us review
inductive reasoning and perform the activities that follow.
review
Inductive Reasoning is the process of observing data, recognizing patterns,
and making generalizations (conjecture) from observations. A conjecture is a
conclusion made from observing data or an educated guess based on patterns.

Activity 1. Complete Me!
Direction: Make a conjecture about each pattern. Then use your conjecture to draw
or write the next term in the pattern.

What’s New
At this point of the module, you are about to learn the Introduction to Sequences
and Patterns. To understand better how to generate patterns, you will have to
perform the simple activity below.
Activity 2. Let’s Discover!
Direction: Read, understand, and perform the given instructions below then
answer the questions asked.
Materials: string, pair of scissors
1) Prepare five (5) strings with equal lengths.
2) Cut the first string once.
Cut the second string twice.
Cut the third string thrice.
Cut the fourth string four times.
Cut the fifth string five times.

(a) How many pieces are there? _____
(b) How many pieces are there? _____
(c) How many pieces are there? _____
(d) How many pieces are there? _____
(e) How many pieces are there? _____

3) Based from your answers, complete the table below.
Number of cuts (x)
Number of pieces (y)

4) Without cutting a string 6 times, how many pieces are there? _____
5) Have you seen a pattern? If yes, describe the pattern and state your conjecture.
Use a formula or equation in your conjecture, where y is the number of pieces
and x is the number of cuts.
6) Using your conjecture, how many pieces of strings can be made from (a)12
cuts? (b) 24 cuts? (c) 35 cuts? and (d) 42 cuts? Show your solutions.

CO_Q1_Mathematics 10_ Module 1

Were you able to complete the task? If yes, you may proceed to the next page. If no,
take time to finish for you to better understand the next discussions.

What Is It
How did you find activity 2? Have you given idea on how to generate a pattern? Let
us process your answers.
1. Based from the task, the complete solution is shown in the table below:
Number of cuts (𝑥)
Number of pieces (y)

1
2

2
3

3
4

4
5

5
6

6
7

2. From the table, notice that the number of pieces (y) of strings is one more than
the number of cuts (x). Thus, we can state our conjecture as, “The number of
pieces (y) when a string is cut x times can be computed using the formula y = x
+ 1.”
3. Using the formula y = x + 1, we can now solve the number of pieces of strings
that can be made from 12 cuts? 24 cuts? 35 cuts? and 42 cuts?
a)
b)
c)
d)

12 cuts, 𝑥 = 12
24 cuts, 𝑥 = 24
35 cuts, 𝑥 = 35
42 cuts, 𝑥 = 42

y = 12 + 1 = 13
y = 24 + 1 = 25
y = 35 + 1 = 36
y = 42 + 1 = 43

Were you able to get the same answers? If yes, very good! If no, I hope you were able
to understand the discussions above. Based from the given activity, the number of
pieces, 𝑦 = 𝑥 + 1, when a string is cut 𝑥 times represents a sequence. Thus, the
values of 𝑦 which are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, . .. is an example of a sequence.
The word sequence means an order in which one thing follows another in succession.
A sequence is an ordered list. For another example, if we write 𝑥, 2𝑥 2 , 3𝑥 3 , 4𝑥 4 , 5𝑥 5 ,
?, what would the next term in the sequence be - the one where the question mark
now stands? The answer is 6𝑥 6 .
definition
A sequence is a set of objects which is listed in a specific order, one after
another. Each member or element in the sequence is called term. The terms in
a sequence can be written as 𝒂𝟏 , 𝒂𝟐 , 𝒂𝟑 , 𝒂𝟒 , . . . , 𝒂𝒏 , . .. which means 𝑎1 is the first
term, 𝑎2 is the second term, 𝑎3 is the third term, …, 𝑎𝑛 is the nth term, and so
on.

CO_Q1_Mathematics 10_ Module 1

Sequences are classified as finite and infinite. A finite sequence contains a limited
number of terms. This means it has an end or last term. Consider the examples
below.
a) Days of the week: {𝑆𝑢𝑛𝑑𝑎𝑦, 𝑀𝑜𝑛𝑑𝑎𝑦, 𝑇𝑢𝑒𝑠𝑑𝑎𝑦, . . . , 𝑆𝑎𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑑𝑎𝑦}
b) First 10 positive perfect squares: {1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100 }
On the other hand, an infinite sequence contains a countless number of terms.
The number of terms of the sequence continues without stopping or it has no end
term. The ellipsis (…) at the end of the following examples shows that the sequences
are infinite. Consider the examples below.
a) Counting numbers: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, . . . }
b) Multiples of 5: {5, 10, 15, 20, 15, . . . }
Sometimes a pattern in the sequence can be obtained and the sequence can be
written using a general term. In the previous example 𝑥, 2𝑥 2 , 3𝑥 3 , 4𝑥 4 , 5𝑥 5 , 6𝑥 6 , . . .,
each term has the same exponent and coefﬁcient. We can write this sequence as
𝑎𝑛 = 𝑛𝑥 𝑛 where 𝑛 = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, . .., and 𝒂𝒏 is called the general or nth term.

A. Finding several terms of a sequence, given the general term:
Example 1.
Find the first four terms of the sequence 𝑎𝑛 = 2𝑛 − 1.
Solution:

To find the first term, let 𝑛 = 1
𝑎𝑛 = 2𝑛 − 1

use the given general term

𝑎𝟏 = 2(𝟏) − 1

substitute 𝑛 by 1

𝑎1 = 2 − 1

perform the operations

𝑎1 = 1

simplify

Repeat the same process for the second to the fourth terms.
Find the second term, 𝑛 = 2

𝑎2 = 2(2) − 1 = 4 − 1 = 3

Find the third term, 𝑛 = 3

𝑎3 = 2(3) − 1 = 6 − 1 = 5

Find the fourth term, 𝑛 = 4

𝑎4 = 2(4) − 1 = 8 − 1 = 7

Therefore, the first four terms of the sequence are 𝟏, 𝟑, 𝟓, 𝟕.
Example 2.
Find the 5th to the 8th terms of the sequence 𝑏𝑛 =
Solution:

Therefore, the 5th to the 8th terms of the sequence are − , , − , .
B. Finding the general term, given several terms of the sequence:
Example 3.
Write the general term of the sequence 5, 12, 19, 26, 33, . ..
Solution:

Notice that each term is 7 more than the previous term. We can search
the pattern using a tabular form.

5 + 7(0)
5 + 7(1)
5 + 7(2)
5 + 7(3)
5 + 7(4)
5 + 7(n – 1)

In the pattern, the number of times that 7 is added to 5 is one less
than the nth term (n – 1). Thus,
𝑎n = 5 + 7(n − 1)

equate 𝑎𝑛 and 5 + 7(n − 1)

𝑎𝑛 = 5 + 7𝑛 − 7

apply distributive property of multiplication

𝑎n = 7𝑛 – 2

combine similar terms

Therefore, the nth term of the sequence is 𝐚𝐧 = 𝟕𝒏 – 𝟐, where 𝑛 = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, . ..

7

CO_Q1_Mathematics 10_ Module 1

Example 4.
Write the general term of the sequence 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, . ..
Solution:

Notice that each term is 2 times the previous term. We can search the
pattern using a tabular form.

Additional Activities
Awesome! Before we end this module, let me introduce a puzzle game called Tower
of Hanoi. Are you familiar with this game? If not, allow me to introduce it to you.

In the Tower of Hanoi puzzle a
player attempts to move a large pile of
disks, known as the Tower, from the
leftmost peg to the rightmost on the
puzzle board. The rules of the puzzle
state that the player can only move one
disk per turn and can never place a
larger disk onto a smaller one at any
time.
If you are interested to play the puzzle, you can search it on the internet. For
the meantime, I just want to use the puzzle game for the purpose of applying
sequences and generating patterns.
