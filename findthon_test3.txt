I. INTRODUCTION

“Kilos Kabataan”

D

In her first public address, the principal mentioned about the
success of the recent “Brigada Eskwela.” Because of this success, the
principal challenged the students, especially the Grade 9 and Grade 10
students, to extend the same service to their community by having a oneSaturday community clean-up which the principal called “Kilos Kabataan
Project.” Volunteers have to sign up until 5 p.m. for the project. Accepting
the principal’s challenge, 10 students immediately signed up for the cleanup. After 10 minutes, there were already 15 who had signed up. After 10
more minutes, there were 20, then 25, 30, and so on. Amazed by the
students’ response to the challenge, the principal became confident that
the youth could be mobilized to create positive change.
The above scenario illustrates a sequence. In this learning module,
you will know more about sequences, and how the concept of a sequence
is utilized in our daily lives.

Hold on to HOPE
Because of the super typhoon Yolanda, there was a big need for blood
donors, medicines, doctors, nurses, medical aides, or any form of medical
assistance. The Red Cross planned to involve different agencies,
organizations, and offices, public and private, local and international, in their
project to have massive medical services. The Red Cross contacted first
three of the biggest networks, and each of these networks contacted three
other networks, and agencies, organizations, and offices, and so on, until
enough of these were contacted. It took one hour for an organization to
contact three other organizations and all the contacts made were completed
within 4 hours. Assume that no group was contacted twice.

D

1. Suppose you are one of the people in the Red Cross who visualized
this project. How many organizations do you think were contacted in
the last round? How many organizations were contacted within 4
hours?

EP
E

2. Make a table to represent the number of organizations, agencies, and
offices who could have been contacted in each round.

D

3. Write an equation to represent the situation. Let the independent
variable be the number of rounds and the dependent variable be the
number of organizations, agencies, and offices that were contacted in
that round.
4. If another hour was used to contact more organizations, how many
additional organizations, agencies, and offices could be contacted?
5. Use the given information in the above situation to formulate problems
involving these concepts.
6. Write the necessary equations that describe the situations or problems
that you formulated.
7. Solve the problems that you formulated.

3. What is the difference between any two consecutive terms?
How was the activity? What new thing did you learn from the
activity?

D

The above activity illustrates a sequence where the difference between
any two consecutive terms is a constant. This constant is called the common
difference and the said sequence is called an arithmetic sequence.
An arithmetic sequence is a sequence where every term after the first
is obtained by adding a constant called the common difference.
The sequences 1, 4, 7, 10, ... and 15, 11, 7, 3, ... are examples of
arithmetic sequences since each one has a common difference of 3 and 4,
respectively.
Is the meaning of arithmetic sequence clear to you? Are you ready
to learn more about arithmetic sequences? If so, then you have to
perform the next activity.

Let us take the number of matchsticks 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25, 28,

sequence. Suppose we want to find the 20th, 50th, and 100th terms of the
sequence. How do we get them? Do you think a formula would help? If so, we
could find a formula for the nth term of the sequence. In this case, it will not
be difficult since we know the common difference of the sequence.

terms between any two nonconsecutive terms of an arithmetic sequence are
known as arithmetic means.

Example: Insert 4 arithmetic means between 5 and 25.
Solution: Since we are required to insert 4 terms, then there will be 6 terms
in all.
Let a1  5 and a6  25. We will insert a2 , a3 , a4 , a5 as shown below:

5, a2 , a3 , a4 , a5 , 25
We need to get the common difference. Let us use a6 a1  5d to

PY

solve for d. Substituting the given values for a6 and a1 , we obtain 25 5  5d.
So, d  4.

4. What is the sum of the integers from 1 to 100?
Let us now denote the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic
sequence a1  a2  a3  ...  an by Sn .

We can rewrite the sum in reverse order, that is,

Sn  an  an 1  an 2  ...  a1.

Rewriting the two equations above using their preceding terms and the
difference d, we would have
Equation 1:

Equation 2 :

Sn an   an  d    an  2d   ...  an   n  1 d 

Adding equation 1 and equation 2, we get

4. Is the sequence an arithmetic sequence? Why?
5. Using the pattern in the areas, what would be the 6th term of the
sequence?
The sequence 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 is called a geometric sequence.

D

A geometric sequence is a sequence where each term after the first
is obtained by multiplying the preceding term by a nonzero constant called the
common ratio.

The common ratio, r, can be determined by dividing any term in the
sequence by the term that precedes it. Thus, in the geometric sequence
1
16 1
32, 16, 8, 4, 2, ... , the common ratio is

Were you able to answer the activity? Which item in the activity did
you find challenging? Let us now discuss how to find the geometric
means between terms of a geometric sequence.
Inserting a certain number of terms between two given terms of a
geometric sequence is an interesting activity in studying geometric sequences.
We call the terms between any two given terms of a geometric sequence the
geometric means.

PY

Example: Insert 3 geometric means between 5 and 3125.
Solution:

Since a5  a1r 4 , then 3125  5r 4 .

C
O

Let a1  5 and a5  3125. We will insert a2 , a3 , and a4 .

Solving for the value of r, we get 625  r 4 or r  5.

D

We obtained two values of r, so we have two geometric sequences.

EP
E

If r  5, the geometric means are
a2  5  5   25,
1

a3  5  5   125, a4  5  5   625.
2

3

Thus, the sequence is 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125.
If r  5, then the geometric means are
a2  5  5   25, a3  5  5   125, a4  5  5   625.

D

Thus, the sequence is 5,  25, 125, 625, 3125.

At this point, you already know some essential ideas about
geometric sequences. Now, we will learn how to find the sum of the first
n terms of a geometric sequence. Do Activity 6.

Activity 6:
Do the following with a partner.

Part 1:

Consider the geometric sequence 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96, ...

Let S5  3  6  12  24  48.

C

There is another method to get the sum of the first 5 terms.

Multiplying both sides by the common ratio 2, we get

D

2S5 6  12  24  48  96

Subtracting 2S5 from S5 , we have

Try the method for the sequence 81, 27, 9, 3, 1, ... and find the sum of
the first 4 terms.
From the activity, we can derive a formula for the sum of the first n
terms, Sn , of a geometric sequence.

6. The World Health Organization (WHO) reported that about 16 million
adolescent girls between 15 and 19 years of age give birth each year.
Knowing the adverse effects of adolescent childbearing on the health
of the mothers as well as their infants, a group of students from
Magiting High School volunteered to help the government in its
campaign for the prevention of early pregnancy by giving lectures to 7
barangays about the WHO Guidelines on teenage pregnancy. The
group started in Barangay 1 and 4 girls attended the lecture. Girls from
other barangays heard about it, so 8 girls attended from Barangay 2,
16 from Barangay 3, and so on.
a. Make a table representing the number of adolescent girls who
attended the lecture from Barangay 1 to Barangay 7 assuming that
the number of attendees doubles at each barangay.

b. Analyze the data in the table and create a formula. Use the formula
to justify your data in the table.

c. Because people who heard about the lecture given by the group
thought that it would be beneficial to them, five more different
barangays requested the group to do the lectures for them. If the
number of young girls who will listen to the lecture from these five
barangays will increase in the same manner as that of the first 7
barangays, determine the total number of girls who will benefit from
the lecture.

Imagine that you were one of the people in the Human Resource
group of a fast growing company in the Philippines. All of you were asked
by the management to create a salary scheme for a very important job
that the company would offer to the best IT graduates this year. The
management gave the salary range good for 2 years, telling everyone in
your group that whoever could give a salary scheme that would best
benefit both the employer and the would-be employees would be given
incentives.

D

1. Form groups of 5. In your respective groups, make use of all the
concepts you learned on geometric sequences considering the starting
salary, the rate of increase, the time frame, etc. in making different
salary schemes and in deciding which one will be the best for both the
employer and the would-be employees.
2. Prepare a visual presentation of your chosen salary scheme with the
different data that were used, together with the formulas and all the
computations done. You may include one or two salary schemes that
you have prepared in your group for comparison.
3. In a simulated board meeting, show your visual presentation to your
classmates who will act as the company’s human resource
administrative officers.

D

A polynomial expression P(x) is an expression of the form
anxn + an – 1xn – 1 + an – 2xn – 2 + … + a1x + a0, an  0

where the nonnegative integer n is called the degree of the polynomial and
coefficients a0, a1, …, an are real numbers.
The terms of a polynomial may be written in any order. However, we
often follow the convention of writing the terms in decreasing powers of the
variable x. In this case, the polynomial expression is said to be in standard
form.

In general, if P(x) and D(x) are polynomials with D(x) ≠ 0, we can write
P( x )
R( x )
 Q( x ) 
or P(x) = Q(x)•D(x) + R(x), where R(x) is either 0 or its
D( x )
D( x )
degree is less than the degree of D(x). If R(x) = 0, then we say that D(x) is a
factor of P(x).

Dividing Polynomials

PY

As previously shown, the procedure for dividing a polynomial by
another polynomial is similar to the procedure used when dividing whole
numbers. Another example is shown below.

C
O

Example: (10x2 + 2x4 + 8 + 7x3) ÷ (2x2 + x – 1)

D

Solution:
First, write the dividend in standard form and insert zeros as
coefficients of any missing term to obtain 2x4 + 7x3 + 10x2 + 0x + 8. Both
dividend and divisor should be in standard form. The long division method is
shown below.

How did you find the activity? What can you say about the procedure?

D

There is a shorter procedure when a polynomial is to be divided by a
binomial of the form (x – r). This method is called synthetic division. In this
procedure, we write only the coefficients.

EP
E

The steps outlined below illustrate synthetic division. The procedure
involves writing numbers in three rows.
Example 1. Use synthetic division to divide P(x) = (3x3 + 4x2 + 8) by ( x  2) .
Step 1: Arrange the coefficients
of P(x) in descending powers of
x, placing 0s for the missing
terms. The leading coefficient of
P(x) becomes the first entry of
the third row.

Step 2: Place the value of r in the

Step 3: The first number in the
second row (–6) is the product of
r (–2) and the number in the third
row (3) of the preceding column.
The second number in the third
row (–2) is the sum of the two
numbers (4 and –6) above it.

Example 2. Use synthetic division to find the quotient of
(x4 + 8x2 – 5x3 – 2 + 15x) ÷ (x – 3)
Solution:
By inspection, the dividend is not in standard form, so there is a need
to rearrange the terms of the polynomial,
Thus, x4 + 8x2 – 5x3 – 2 + 15x = x4 – 5x3 + 8x2 + 15x – 2.

STATEMENT

EP

The previous activity shows the proof of the Remainder Theorem:
The Remainder Theorem

If the polynomial P(x) is divided by (x – r), the remainder R is a
constant and is equal to P(r).

D

R = P(r)

Thus, there are two ways to find the remainder when P(x) is divided by
(x – r), that is:
(1) use synthetic division, or
(2) calculate P(r).
Similarly, there are two ways to find the value of P(r):
(1) substitute r in the polynomial expression P(x), or
(2) use synthetic division.

Example 1. Find the remainder when (5x2 – 2x + 1) is divided by (x + 2).
Solution:
a. Using the Remainder Theorem:
P(x) = 5x2 – 2x + 1, r = –2
P(–2) = 5(–2)2 – 2(–2) + 1
P(–2) = 5(4) + 4 + 1
P(–2) = 20 + 4 + 1 = 25

PY

Therefore, the remainder when P(x) = 5x2 – 2x + 1 is divided by x + 2
is 25.

The Factor Theorem

C
O

Sometimes, the remainder when P(x) is divided by (x – r) is 0. This
means that x – r is a factor of P(x). Equivalently, P(r) = 0. This idea is
illustrated by the Factor Theorem.

The polynomial P(x) has x – r as a factor if and only if P(r) = 0.

EP
E

D

Proof: There are two parts of the proof of the Factor Theorem, namely:
Given a polynomial P(x),
1. If (x – r) is a factor of P(x), then P(r) = 0.
2. If P(r) = 0, then (x – r) is a factor of P(x).
Activity 4:

D

The proof is a consequence of the Remainder Theorem. Fill in the blanks to
complete the statement. Write your answers in your notebook.
1. x – r is a factor of P(x) if and only if the remainder R of P(x)  (x – r)
is _______.

2. By the Remainder Theorem, R = 0 if and only if ____________.
3. Thus, (x – r) is a factor of P(x) if and only if ____________.

Let us see how the Factor Theorem is used in the following examples.
Example 1. Show that (x – 1) is a factor of 3x3 – 8x2 + 3x + 2.
Solution:
Using the Factor Theorem, we have:
P(1) = 3(1)3 – 8(1)2 +3(1) + 2
=3–8+3+2
=0

PY

Since P(1) = 0, then x – 1 is a factor of 3x3 – 8x2 + 3x + 2.

Example 2. Find the value of k for which the binomial (x + 4) is a factor of
x4 + kx3 – 4x2.

D

C
O

Solution:
If (x + 4) is a factor of P(x) = x4 + kx3 – 4x2, we know from the Factor
Theorem that P(–4) = 0.
P(–4) = (–4)4 + k(–4)3 – 4(–4)2 = 0
256 – 64k – 64 = 0
64k 192

To check whether the answer is correct or not, use synthetic division to
