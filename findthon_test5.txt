Language register Refers to the formality of language which one speaks. It is through _ that you are able to determine the kind of lexicon or vocabulary to use as well as the kind of structure to be used.

Crystal (1964) discussed style and register
Language being the product of interaction among the members of society, must ultimately be studied according to the social context in which it is found

A set is an unordered collection of distinct objects.

A set is said to contain its elements.

A set is an unordered collection of distinct objects.

The objects in a set are called the elements, or members, of the set.

To denote membership we use the ∈ symbol, as in ∈ {2,4,17,24}.

An ellipsis is used to specify a long sequence that follows a pattern. An ellipsis is often used after two or more members of the sequence, and before the last one, as follows: {1,2,...,n}.

Set builder notation lists on the right side of the colon the property that any set element, specified on the left side on the colon, has to satisfy.

Positive integers set builder notation: N+ = {x : x ∈ N and x > 0}

Set builder notation of integers: Z = {x : x ∈ N or -x ∈ N}

Set builder notation for rational numbers: Q = {a/b : a ∈ Z, b ∈ Z, b  ≠ 0}

A is said to be a subset of B if and only if every element of A is also an element of B, in which we write A ⊆ B.

A is a strict subset of B if A is a subset of B and A is not equal to B, which is denoted by A ⊂ B. For example, {4,23} ⊂ {2,4,17,23} ⊆ {2,4,17,23}

Two sets A and B are considered equal if and only if they have the same elements. This is denoted by A = B. A = B if and only if A ⊆ B and B  ⊆ A.

Union is denoted by A ∪ B = {x : x ∈ A or x ∈ B}

Intersection is denoted by A ∩ B = {x : x ∈ A and x ∈ B}

Difference is denoted by A \ B = {x : x ∈ A and x ∉ B}

Non-membership is denoted as in 5  ∉ {2,4,17,23}.

Given a set A, the Cardinality of A, also known as the size of A, is simply the number of elements in A. The cardinality of A is denoted by |A|. For example, if A = {2,4,17,23}, then |A| = 4.

A set with one element is called a Singleton

A set can contain sets as its elements. For example, {{2, 4}, {17}, 23} is a perfectly valid set with three elements, two of them sets.

The power set of a set A is the set of all subsets of A, and is denoted by 2<latex>^A</latex>. That is, 2<latex>^A</latex>= {S : S ⊆ A}. For example, for A= {2, 4, 17, 23}, we have 2<latex>^A</latex>= { ∅, {2}, {4}, {17}, {23}, {2, 4}, {2, 17}, {2, 23}, {4, 17}, {4, 23}, {17, 23}, {2, 4, 17}, {2, 4, 23}, {2, 17, 23}, {4, 17, 23}, {2, 4, 17, 23}}. The cardinality of this set is 16, and 16 = 2<latex>^4</latex>.

The set theory defines the different types of sets, symbols and operations performed.

Sets are represented as a collection of well-defined objects or elements and it does not change from person to person. A set is represented by a capital letter.

N: Set of all natural numbers Z: Set of all integers
Q: Set of all rational numbers
R: Set of all real numbers
Z+: Set of all positive integers

The order of a set defines the number of elements a set is having. It describes the size of a set. The order of set is also known as the Cardinality.

The empty set is denoted by ∅. It is the unique set without elements. It holds that ∅ ⊆ A for any set A. Also called as Null set or Void set

A set which consists of a definite number of elements is called a finite set.

A set which is not finite is called an infinite set.

The two sets A and B are said to be Equal if they have exactly the same elements, the order of elements do not matter.

The two sets A and B are said to be Disjoint if the set does not contain any common element.

If the number of elements is the same for two different sets, then they are called equivalent sets. The order of sets does not matter here.

A set ‘A’ is said to be a subset of B if every element of A is also an element of B, denoted as A ⊆ B. Even the null set is considered to be the subset of another set. In general, a subset is a part of another set.

If A ⊆ B and A ≠ B, then A is called the proper subset of B and it can be written as A⊂B.

Set A is said to be the superset of B if all the elements of set B are the elements of set A. It is represented as A ⊃ B.

A set which contains all the sets relevant to a certain condition is called the universal set. It is the set of all possible values.

The complement of any set, say P, is the set of all elements in the universal set that are not in set P. It is denoted by P’.

If set A and set B are two sets then the cartesian product of set A and set B is a set of all ordered pairs (a,b), such that a is an element of A and b is an element of B. It is denoted by A × B.

If set A and set B are two sets, then set A difference set B is a set which has elements of A but no elements of B. It is denoted as A – B.

Discrete Mathematics deals with counting numbers, or whole numbers, and algebra. Can be compared to a digital clock. Discrete Mathematics deals with mathematical topics where it analyzes data where values are separated.

Truth Values are true and false

Propositional Variables are variables that are used to represent a propositions: p, q, r, s, etc.

Logical Equivalence - Two propositions P and Q are logically equivalent (P ≡ Q) if and only if P and Q have the same truth value in all cases.

Rules of Logic specify the precise meanings of mathematical statements.

Continuous Mathematics deals with continuous functions, differential, and integral calculus, also real numbers and approximations, can be compared to an analog clock.

Statement is a declarative sentence that can either be true or false but not both. Also called as Proposition.

Computers operate on discrete data (binary strings).

Contingency - a compound proposition that is neither always true nor always false.

Propositional Logic is the area of logics that deals with propositions.

Conjunction - represents "and". P ^ Q is true if both P and Q are true. Example, if P is "It is sunny", and Q is "It is warm", then P ^ Q means "It is sunny and warm."

Negation - represents "not". If P is true, -P is false, and vice versa. Example, if P means "It is raining", then -P means "It is not raining".

Disjunction - represents "or." P V Q is true if at least one of P or Q is true. Example, if P is "I will study," and Q is "I will watch TV," then P V Q means I will study or watch TV (or both).

Implication - represents "if...then." P ->Q is false only if P is true and Q is false. Example, if P is "It rains," and Q is "I will bring umbrella." then P -> Q means "If it rains, then I will bring an umbrella"

Biconditional - represents "if and only if." P <-> Q is true if P and Q have the same truth value, either both true or both false will result in True. Example, if P is "I will bring snacks," and Q is "You will bring drinks," then P <-> Q means "I will bring snacks if and only if you bring drinks."

Truth Table - lists all possible combinations of the values of the operands. It is used to determine the truth value of a compound proposition for all possible truth values of its components.

Exclusive OR (XOR) - represents “either, but not both.” P O Q is true if exactly one of P or Q is true, but not both. Example, if P is “I will watch a movie,” and Q is “I will play a video game,” then P O Q means “I will watch a movie or play a video game, but not both.”

Tautology - a compound proposition that is always true regardless of the truth values of its components. Example, P V -Q.

Contradiction - a compound proposition that is always false regardless of the truth values of its components. P ^ -P.

Proofs is the basis of the correct mathematical arguments

Logical Operators transform one or more propositions to a new proposition.

Binary operators transform two propositions to a new proposition.

Level of context most english-speaking cultures are low-context, meaning they put a message into explicit words. 
In these cultures, saying “no” when you mean “no” is just considered straightforward orhonest. High-context cultures, such as Japan, expect the listener to pick up more meaning from the general situation. For example, Asians sometimes say “yes” or “maybe” when they actually mean “no” according to the Diversity Council. Asians often consider an outright refusal blunt rather than honest.

Braj Kachru Concept of WE was introduced by him
The famouse "Three Concentric Circle of Asian Englishes" attributed to _ presents the three circle: Inner Circle with ENL, Outer Circle with ESL, and the Expanding Circle with EFL.
